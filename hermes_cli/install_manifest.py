"""Install-manifest functions for bundled desktop installs.

``.hermes-install.json`` is a small marker file next to the managed checkout.
It sits in the parent directory of ``hermes_cli/``. This is the same anchor
rule as ``.install_method`` in ``hermes_cli/config.py``. The marker describes
the running code, not ``$HERMES_HOME``. Two installs that share one data
directory cannot overwrite each other's marker.

The file records where a checkout came from and where its updates come from:

    {
      "schemaVersion": 1,
      "installMode": "bundled" | "source",
      "channel": "stable" | "main",
      "manageStyle": "adopted" | "ejected",  # optional
      "pinnedCommit": "<sha>",       # optional
      "pinnedTag": "v0.17.0"         # optional, bundled installs only
    }

Semantics
---------
* ``installMode: "source"`` — the user manages the checkout. ``hermes update``
  owns updates (git pull, tag checkout, or ZIP fallback). **A missing file
  means source mode.** Every install that exists today is a source install.
  No migration is necessary.
* ``installMode: "bundled"`` — the checkout came from payloads inside the
  desktop installer. The desktop app owns updates. It rebuilds the checkout
  offline after the app updates itself. ``hermes update`` refuses and points
  at the in-app updater.
* ``channel`` — ``"main"`` follows the git main branch (source mode only).
  ``"stable"`` follows tagged releases. :func:`resolve_update_channel` gives
  the effective channel. ``update.channel`` in config.yaml can override the
  channel for source installs. Bundled installs are always stable.
* ``manageStyle`` — how the install got into its current mode.
  ``installMode`` says where it is now. Values:

  - ``"adopted"`` — the install is desktop-managed (a resident bundle's
    static manifest, or an installer run that selected bundled mode).
  - ``"ejected"`` — the user ran ``hermes update --eject``. This opt-out is
    permanent, although the resulting ``installMode`` is ``"source"``.
  - missing — a legacy checkout from before manifests, or a plain source
    install.

This is a pure-stdlib leaf module. It does not import hermes_cli.config.
A config import would pull the full config machinery into every consumer.
The desktop bootstrap and the install scripts also write this file without
Python.
