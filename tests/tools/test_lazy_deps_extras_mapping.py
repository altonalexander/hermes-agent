"""LAZY_DEPS maps a feature name to an extra in pyproject.toml.

Two things need a test here.

The map itself: each value must name an extra that pyproject.toml declares.
Nothing else checks that. A typo makes the feature raise FeatureUnavailable
at first use, on the one machine that enabled that backend.

The reader: extra_specs expands a `hermes-agent[x]` reference, and that code
is ours. A cycle or a silent empty result would each ship a
wrong package set. uv resolves the extras its own way and cannot catch a
fault in our reader.

Nothing here restates a version. pyproject.toml holds the specs, uv.lock
pins them, and `uv lock --check` and `uv audit` read the lockfile.
